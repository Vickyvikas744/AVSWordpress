It is because most of these shoes are made of leather. Thus the leather industry also relies to some extent on the Safety and <strong>Military footwear industry<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>The military men are always on duty to protect the nation and to do that they need to be safeguarded. And for this purpose, <strong>army shoes, <\/strong>also known as \u201ccombat boots\u201d were manufactured that are now becoming a trendy choice for civilians.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>These shoes are designed for the military man who needs to climb high mountain ranges, cross dense forests, patrol streets in difficult environmental conditions and perform rigorous combat training daily. <strong>Army shoes<\/strong> make it easy for them to do such activities and protect themselves in difficult situations.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>These <strong>army shoes<\/strong> are designed in such a manner that they are highly durable, light in weight, and resistant to heat and oil which is why they are in high demand among the defence professionals.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Well talking about the <strong>military footwear industry<\/strong>, it is on the verge to grow globally. Increased demand for safety measures in the defence sectors is creating a space for army shoe manufacturers in the market.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>The Indian military shoes are also exported to different countries. It is emerging as a great source of generating foreign exchange revenue every year for the country along with creating new employment opportunities.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Also the<strong> military footwear industry<\/strong> is constantly evolving and introducing new types of footwear for defence personnel. For instance- Non-slip sole, waterproof boots, and steel toes are some of the features that are making the <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/avsgroup.in\/product-tag\/military-boots\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">military shoes<\/a> more appealing. Earlier in India, the <strong>army shoes<\/strong> were designed and manufactured only by the \u201cOrdnance factories board\u201d.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>But in 2017, the Ministry of Defence announced that private companies too can manufacture and purchase army shoes. This opened a new path for the <strong>military footwear industry<\/strong> in India and is now becoming a major source of income for many of the footwear companies.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>In addition to this, the \u201cDefence Research and Development organization\u201d decided to design shoes that will track a soldier\u2019s location. Some major market players in the military footwear industry of India are Reebok, Under Armour, Corcoran, and Danner.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Have you ever thought about the labourers who work hard for days and nights just to make our lives easier by manufacturing products?? They are always at a high risk of getting hurt while working in a factory.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>To avoid any mishaps at the workplace and protect the feet of the worker in factories and industries, <strong>safety shoes<\/strong> came into existence. These shoes are also known as steel-toe boots and steel-capped boots. To reduce the stress at the workplace about falling or slipping on a greasy floor or getting hurt by sharp objects these <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/avsgroup.in\/product-category\/safety-shoes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">safety shoes<\/a> can act as a stress reliever.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Just like the army shoes, these <strong>safety shoes<\/strong> are also available in the market with a wide variety of styles and features such as- steel toe cap, shock absorption, steel midsole, anti-skid, oil and heat resistant, and abrasion-resistant.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Moreover, these shoes protect the feet from electrical shocks as they are made of non-conductive materials like leather and rubber. These shoes also safeguard the feet from cold weather, falling objects, or sharp objects.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>With the advancement in the <strong>footwear industry<\/strong>, the safety shoes became fashionable as the fashion industry got involved in manufacturing them. There are many small and large scale industries in India which are involved in manufacturing <strong>safety boots<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Traditionally made by using steel as the main component, the manufacturing industries have now started using aluminum and a kind of plastic named thermoplastic polyurethane.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>The <strong>footwear industry <\/strong>is constantly evolving and is also trying to improve the design of boots. The Indian army used the same design for 130 years; the only change done in it was the addition of a directly moulded sole.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>But now as the footwear market is growing there is a wide variety of boots available for labourers and military men. Many companies are working on developing military and safety shoe designs by the use of nylon, rubber, and leather.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>The safety footwear market is now adopting different strategies, performing mergers with other companies, and planning to launch a new product range to make the most out of it.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Upcoming changes in the Indian military and safety shoe industry in 2020-<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Going global by outsourcing<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Company mergers and investments.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">New shoe designs with new safety guidelines<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Increased revenue generation<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>It is estimated that this industry will grow at 6% CAGR between 2020-2026.
