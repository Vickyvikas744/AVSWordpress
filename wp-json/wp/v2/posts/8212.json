This is because of a decrease in demand, along with the shutting of stores in virus-driven countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only this pandemic has affected direct sales, but it has done something good as well for the global footwear market. It has made shoemakers rethink and reframe their marketing and manufacturing processes and strategies.

Many brands have postponed the launch of new products plus collections and are waiting for the situation to get normal. Additionally, as the country is facing a dreadful time, its <strong>footwear industry<\/strong> is dealing with a serious problem when it comes to supply chain management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Huge cancellations saw the industry lose around $1 billion worth of export orders. -(Aqeel Ahmed, chairman, Council For Leather Export)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Given the closure of retail outlets and restriction of delivery of non-essential items in certain areas, the revenues for FY2021 are expected to drop by 10-15 percent as compared to FY2020, with a larger impact on profitability\u201d- stated by ICRA.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As the manufacturing units in China have been closed and now with many Indian companies deciding to boycott China products, it is resulting in huge loss to the Indian shoemakers and suppliers. The country\u2019s footwear manufacturers highly rely on China for importing components like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Insoles<\/li><li>Outsoles<\/li><li>Laces<\/li><li>Shoe lining<\/li><li>Shank board<\/li><li>Buckles<\/li><li>Foam<\/li><li>Packing material<\/li><li>Ornaments<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With the scarcity of these components, it has led many brands to increase the prices of footwear. Whereas, some brands are offering discounts on footwear to generate revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with this, the other footwear companies that were importing components within the country, witnessed a tremendous loss since the corona outbreak hit the country both online and offline. Agra, being the hub of the leather industry is facing a tough time due to the decrease in sales. Footwear, worth RS.3000 crores are exported every year from Agra to Europe, but this pandemic has directly hit hard on the exporting business of footwear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although, many suppliers are continuing to cater to their target group even in these difficult times by leveraging online platforms. Amongst which <strong>AVS International<\/strong>, being a reputed brand name for supplying a versatile range of footwear is all set to serve its customers with shoes that are comfortable and durable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-ray-of-hope-in-these-difficult-times\"><strong>Ray of hope in these difficult times&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the brands are about to open their stores, they will be focusing more on the online selling of their products. The <strong>footwear industry<\/strong> will now rely more on the local component suppliers that will create new employment opportunities. But as the <strong>coronavirus impact on the footwear industry <\/strong>seems to have a long-term effect on the footwear market, its high time that companies redefine their policies and innovate ways to make the best out of it. <strong>AVS International Pvt.
